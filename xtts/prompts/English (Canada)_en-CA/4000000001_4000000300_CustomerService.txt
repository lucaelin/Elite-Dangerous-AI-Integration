Morning, Chris speaking, how may I help you? 
Call me if you need me to bring over something else.
Will you be picking up in-store or shall we ship it to you?
Would you mind being put on hold for a while?
You should call the shipping line since it’s only updated on the web.
Let me give you the container number here.
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you due to that. 
It is actually confined to ship.
Ok just one moment here. 
Perfect, then let me contact them. 
I am sorry to hear about that. 
You should not have had to go through it.
I’m just checking the status of a billing, please.
Ok, what's the billing number?
We feel bad for the unpleasant experience you had to go through. 
We’re sorry and we can confirm the earliest solution to your problem.
Thanks for buying from us!

Let me know when you get prompted by the download wizard. 
How about we put a freeze on your account? 
Is there anything else I can do for you?
No, that's all, thank you. 
Ok, thank you, have a nice day, bye-bye. 
Our best guys are already on it. 
We need to get an invoice for the charge made in March.
Can you send me the billing number for the container?
It just depends on how many my warehouse can take. 
How many containers will you pick up today?
I can do one right now but I think both need to be picked up. 
If the items are released then the charges are guaranteed. 
Is there anyway you can pick up the containers tomorrow?
Ok, sure, let me just email you.
Yes, that’s why I’m trying to get this information.
Yes, no problem, just send us the message.
I will also need the proof of release when I pick up the containers.
Okay, no problem, I will just send you the invoice.
Hi, how are you doing?
Make sure you select the enterprise version of the software.
You can't pause the download.
I got a call from you, that’s why I called you back. 
Would you like an invoice?
We will provide you with the invoice.
It is probably the wrong number, then.
We don’t support your device at the moment.
Once we get everything up and running, we will get back to you.
I am your personal customer care manager.
Oh, they gave the wrong number then, sorry. 
Unplug the computer if your screen freezes.
Good afternoon, who am I speaking to? 
I did a real billing on your website. 
I’ll give you a direct phone number for the real billing department.
Ok, that would be great!
Why don’t you take our valid coupon?
Make sure there aren't any other devices connected on the network.
Are there any exports remaining at all?
Let me get my team on it.
How long is the wait time?
You made a wise choice contacting our support. 
Ok, I will keep waiting, then.
